# DAD Project 2

## Ladl Supermarket App

### Description
The Ladl Supermarket App is an online marketplace for all your grocery needs. Feel free to browse and find the products you need. You can browse by Category, or view all products. If you found a product you liked, add them to your cart! There is a shopping cart icon at the top to show you how many items you currently have in your cart. Finally, save your Name and Address for future use in the top right User icon. Enjoy the Ladl Supermarket App in 3 dynamic modes. 

### Online Deployment
The application is deployed and available for testing at https://mckp0.github.io/dad-project-2/#/

### Challenges
1. One of the goals I set out is to prepare all the widgets and classes required beforehand, in order to increase code abstraction and reusability. However, it resulted in incomplete or not working widgets that require refactoring or re-doing later on in the project. 
2. It was time consuming to hard-code each responsive view for every possible layout. Furthermore, it is hard to account for all possible devices with this method.
3. Another challenge was creating intuitive UI but also ensuring they have functionality and are responsive.

### Key Learning Points
1. It is important to plan out the code architecture and draw out potential classes, widgets and their hierarchy before jumping straight into it. 
2. Having dynamic widgets that rearrange according to the screen is helpful, such as the Wrap class.
3. Through trial and error, as well as research from other existing web designs, it makes the designing process easier as we can borrow ideas and implement it with our own ideas.
